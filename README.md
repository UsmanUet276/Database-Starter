# Database-Starter
SQL script is mendatory which is already pushed
1. Create a new database named Lab2
2. Create table with following schema
Student(RegistrationNumber:String, Name:String , Department:String , Session:Number,
CGPA:Number, Address:String)
3. Use the student table to create the following CRUD operations
* Add a Student
* Edit Student
* List of Students
* Search Student
* Delete Student
4. UI components for the fields should be appropriate. Change the Edit Use case to optimize such that all the
fields should not be updated in table, you need to detect, which field has been changed on frontend, then
update only those fields which have been changed. E.g. for editing of student, we change registration
number, then database should only update only registration number.
